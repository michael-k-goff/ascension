# Buildings

## Construction

The building of intracity objects (factories, etc.) and intercity objects (roads, rail lines, canals etc.) will both be done through a SimCity like interface. The player selects what is to be built, then clicks on the desired spot. All construction will take some time and resources. The time may depend on what resources are available. Some construction may be impossible if needed resources are not available at the given spot.

To illustrate with an example, suppose a lumber mill requires 100 gold 50 lumber, and 10 turns to build. To start construction, there must be 10 gold and 5 lumber at the map location where it is built. Each turn, an additional 10 gold and 5 lumber are required, or construction will be stalled. Since the location will demand additional gold and lumber for the duration of the construction, these resources will flow into the location if available from neighboring locations.

## Maintenance

Buildings have maintenance costs, which might be, say, 2 gold and 1 lumber per turn for the lumber mill. If the resources for maintenance are not available at the tile, the building may become ineffective or outright lost. This feature is designed to prevent premature overbuilding and to regulate the pace of expansion.

## Operation

Among the properties required for a building to work effective are workers. When construction commences, a certain number of construction workers are required, or construction is stalled. These workers may either decrease the unemployment rate, or if unemployed workers are not available, they may detracted from the workforce available for other buildings. Workers are also required for general operation of the building. For some buildings, a certain level of education may be required for (full) functionality. Crime and pollution may detract from a building's functionality.
