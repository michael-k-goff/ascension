# Technology

The game will have a large scope to represent the full of human and post-human history. The overall "time" of the game will be set by the current technology position. I am uncertain now if there will be a separate, overall set of known technologies, or if technology will be embodied in buildings and properties on the map. In the latter case, civilizational decline and technology forgetting may be possible.

The scope will be large. If there is a traditional tech tree, then I would like to have at least 1000 technologies. If not, then whatever system is used should have comparable scope.

The eras are planned as follows, with possible major modification.

## Paleolithic

May be divided Lower, Middle, and Upper Paleolithic. This era begins with bipedalism and the first use of stone tools (3 million BCE), and it lasts until the advent of agriculture. If the Paleolithic is not divided, then the line between the Paleolithic and Neolithic may be moved to as early as the domestication of dogs.

Civilization size: a few square kilometers, with a larger amount of territory known to scouts. Is nomadic, and forced to be by various periods of climate change.

## Neolithic

Begins with agriculture (9500 BCE) and lasts until writing.

Civilization size: a few hundred square kilometers.

## Bronze Age

Begins with bronze working and writing (3500 BCE), lasts until iron working.

Civilization size: a few tens of thousand of square kilometers. This is the first time you can control multiple cities and ethnicities.

## Iron Age

Begins with iron working (1200 BCE), lasts through antiquity.

Civilization size: comparable to the height of the Roman Empire or the Han Empire.

## Middle Ages

In historical terms, lasts from about 300 CE to 1300.

Civilization size: similar to that of the Iron Age.

## Early Modern Age

In historical terms, lasts from 1300-1776.

Civilization size: continental, with some off-continent colonies.

## Industrial Age

In historical terms, lasts from the mass production of the Watt steam engine (1776) to the first power plant (1882).

Civilization size: continental, with off-continent colonies.

## Machine Age

Lasts from the first power plant to the invention of the atomic bomb (1945).

Civilization size: multiple continents.

## Atomic Age

Lasts from the first atomic bomb to the World Wide Web (1991).

Civilization size: multiple continents.

## Information Age

Lasts from the World Wide Web (1991) to some point probably around the middle of the 21st century.

Civilization size: global.

## Nanotech Age

Entails widespread use of novel nanomaterials, advanced biotechnology, artificial intelligence capable of performing most work, and permanent settlement of Earth orbit, the Moon, and Mars.

Civilization size: cislunar, with settlements on Mars.

## Transhuman Era

Through biotechnology, cybernetics, and artificial intelligence, humans are modified beyond recognition from today's perspective. Settlements are established as far as the Kuiper Belt. A technological singularity occurs.

Civilization size: solar system.

## Interstellar Era

From settlement of the Oort Cloud to nearly star systems.

Civilization size: 100 light years from the home planet.

## Galactic Era

Settlement of the full galaxy, Dyson spheres, and the first wormholes.

Civilization size: galactic.

## Cosmic Era

Faster-than-light travel and astroengineering projects on a galactic scale.

Civilization size: visible universe.

## Transcendent Era

Begins with the traversal of higher dimensions and travel beyond the cosmic horizon, entails multiverse traversal, and culimates with the Omega Point and simulation transcendence.

Civilization size: infinite.
