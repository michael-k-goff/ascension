# Other Civilizations

Like in the Civilization games, there will be other civilizations with which the player can trade, conduct diplomacy, or fight wars. The Social properties discussed above are meant to prevent the player from conquering other civilizations early in the game, for too great of expansion can make the empire ungovernable. As the game progresses, new civilizations will spawn and be meant to match the player in technology level. This includes extraterrestrial civilizations.

Other civilizations will be governed by the same mechanics as the player's civilization and are controlled by AI.

## Warfare

In a state of war, moving units onto another civilization's territory captures that territory temporarily. Territory only changes hands permanently through a peace settlement or through entirely conquering another civilization. On temporarily occupied territory, it is impossible to build buildings or take advantage of existing buildings except in a limited way by force.

Units require food and supplies for maintenance, or else they will dwindle. Therefore, when invading another civilization, it is necessary to plan supply chains. Because maintainence of buildings in enemy territory is expensive, it can be very costly to conduct protracted wars.
